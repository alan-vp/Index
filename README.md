## Javascript Projects.
<a name="weather"></a>
*   [Weather Search Repo](https://github.com/alan-vp/weatherSearch)
[Live version](https://cute-meerkat-09dd3b.netlify.app/)
The main goal of this project was to consume an API and render the information dynamically. The app is connected to the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) which allows the user to get the weather conditions of a particular city and the maximum and minimum temperature of the current day.


## Ruby on Rails Projects.
<a name="checkpoint"></a>
  * [Checkpoint Repo](https://github.com/alan-vp/checkpoint_access/blob/main/README.md)
 This is an app focused on companies or organizations. It's an entrance/exit tracker of employees, company vehicles, and visitors.
The challenge was to build the app from scratch, design the architecture, models, and associations between them. Implement authorization and authentication methods.
The general functionalities for all users are: login, logout, edit their profile, and check all the entrance and exit registers among other standard functionalities.
For the admin, there are exclusive functionalities: CRUD actions for users, companies, or company vehicles.
For non-admin there are also exclusive functionalities: create entrance and exit records.

  * [Handdy Repo](https://github.com/alan-vp/Handdy-App) This app emulates a marketplace where people can offer or request personal services to carry out repairs at home/office.
    This app was also built from scratch and has standard CRUD actions for users, login, logout, authorization, and authentication methods.
    An interesting function is the option to chat between users.

  <a name="tellevo"></a>
   * [Te llevo Repo](https://github.com/JuliJuarez/tellevo) This app is inspired in "Bla blah car" a carpooling app, where users can offer and request for roadtrips to save money in expenses.
